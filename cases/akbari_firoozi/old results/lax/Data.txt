Spatial step = 1000.0 m
Time step = 150 s
Simulation duration = 20:00:00
Mass imbalance (total inflow - total outflow) = 42758.43 m^3 = 0.3389% of inflow.
Peak inflow = 300.00 m^3/s
Peak outflow = 283.86 m^3/s
Attenuation = 5.38%
Median volume entry time = 7:37:30
Median volume arrival time = 10:17:30
